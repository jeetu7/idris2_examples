# idris2_examples

This repository contains examples for idris2. The main objective of this repo is that people coming from more traditional languages like python, C++, Java etc can start as fast as possible in Idris2.

Get Started
===========
Install Idris2 as given on the website of Idris2

How to Compile
==============
Lets suppose your program name is myprogram.idr then you can compile it into myprogram. 

    idris2 myprogram.idr -o myprogram
    
The output executable will be in the build/exec/ directory with the name as given in the argument of -o flag. You can execute it easily.

    build/exec/myprogram
    
Sequence
========
Follow the programs in the sequence of filename like 1_<filename>.idr and I wish you GodSpeed. May the Force be with you.

Note
====
Any file which has WIP (ie work-in-progress) written in the first line will not work/compile as expected. Just ignore it (or complete it and send a pull request).
